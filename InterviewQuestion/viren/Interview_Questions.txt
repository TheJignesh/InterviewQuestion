why stored procedure is called as precompiled
Answer
When we create and execute the stored procedure for the first time it creates an ExecutionPlan
Execution plan means which is the best and quickiest way to get the data, so when stored procedure 
is created it has an execution plan, now but after subsquent runs since stored procedure has the 
execution plan it will get the data quickly as soon as possible hence that's why it is called 
pre-compiled

what is application pool in iis:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJmURky86-Q&ab_channel=kudvenkat

 --->application pools contains more than one web application, each application pool 
    has its own worker process
Application pools allow you to isolate your applications from one another, 
even if they are running on the same server. 
This way, if there is an error in one app, it won't take down other applications

Additionally, applications pools allow you to separate
different apps which require different levels of security.
