SSL, TLS, HTTP, HTTPS :- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hExRDVZHhig&ab_channel=PowerCertAnimatedVideos

SSL:- Secure socket layer
TLS:- Transport layer security
HTTPS:-Hyper text transport protocol secure
HTTP:- Hyper text transport protocol 



Where vs Having
Where condition is faster then having
because Where first filter the rows and then returns while having
will get the rows first and then filters it

Order of where,groupby,having,orderby

WHERE more filters on the rows
GROUP BY combines those rows into groups
HAVING filters groups
ORDER BY arranges the remaining rows/groups

MVC Life Cycle
---------------
When mvc appln starts it first call the application start method in global.ascx file
in application_start() method all the filters and routes are getting registered for e.g :- 
(RouteTable.Routes)
the routes which is defined in the route.config file 
for e.g:-

            routes.MapRoute(
                name: "Default",
                url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
                defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional }
            );

All these routes is present in the RouteTable

The UrlRouting module will check the request url from the client and check whether the given url is matching with any of the routes present 
in the RouteTable.

There is a handler called as Mvchandler which will select the controller from the list of controllers.
after that it will execute the specific controller. after executing the controller the actioninvoker  will invoke the action method in that particular
controller and after execution of action method the viewengine will determine which type of view is to be executed and thus gives the response.

                    type: "POST",  ------------> whether u want to post the data or get
                    url: "/Home/GetSecuredData",  ---->which controller's action method u want to call
                    contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",  ---> most of the time it is always the same

wht is bundling  ---->https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/bundling-and-minification-in-asp.net-mvc	
merge all the file in single bundle, bundle helps us to get all the files in single request
other wise it needs to call multiple servers request to load each and every file.	

how to create bundle

using System.Web;
using System.Web.Optimization;

public class BundleConfig
{
    public static void RegisterBundles(BundleCollection bundles)
    {   
        bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/bs-jq-bundle").Include(
                      "~/Scripts/bootstrap.js",
                      "~/Scripts/jquery-3.3.1.js"));

        //the following creates bundles in debug mode;
        //BundleTable.EnableOptimizations = true;
    }
} 

//Global.ascx
protected void Application_Start()
{
    AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();
    RouteConfig.RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);
    BundleConfig.RegisterBundles(BundleTable.Bundles);
}
		
wht is minification --->https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/bundling-and-minification-in-asp.net-mvc

1.display templates.(DISPLAY,DISPLAYFOR,DISPLAYFORMODEL)			
2.editor templates.(EDITOR,EDITORFOR,EDITORFORMODEL)			
			
DIFF between displayfor and labelfor
-->
LabelFor is to show the name of a property (and clicking the name should set focus to the corresponding field).
DisplayFor is to show the value of a property

[Display("Name:")]
public string Name{get;set;}

@Html.DisplayFor(m=m>m.Name)// this will show (read only) "Mohammad"
@HTML.LabelFor(m=>m.Name)// this will show "Name:"


Customtemplate -Part45	
		
Need for customtemplate			
if suppose we use editformodel 			
and there is one property of datetime			
but editorformodel will create a normal textbox			
we want to have a datetime control so that user can select date.			
Hence to do that we have to use custom template for datetime.

Errors:

Errors are unexpected issues that may arise during computer program execution.
Errors cannot be handled.
All Errors are exceptions.
Termination of program will happen and cannot be handle
Exceptions:

Exceptions are unexpected events that may arise during run-time.
Exceptions can be handled using try-catch mechanisms.
All exceptions are not errors
Terminaiton of program can be avoided using try catch block

what is Design Pattern

Design Pattern vs Architetural pattern

Desing pattern is at code level  Factory, iterator, Singleton it basically time tested practices of OOP  problems
Architecture pattern is like at block level e.g MVVM , MVC  block design

Desing Pattern is divided into three
1.Creational:- deals with object creation and initialization
e.g:-singleton, factory, abstract factory
Factory pattern:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGGg9ecy0K4&list=PL6n9fhu94yhUbctIoxoVTrklN3LMwTCmd&index=2

2.Structural:-This pattern is focuses on decoupling interface and implementation of classes
e.g :- adapter and bridge
adapter:- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMfc_oPwp3U&list=RDCMUCCTVrRB5KpIiK6V2GGVsR1Q&start_radio=1&rv=BMfc_oPwp3U&t=3

3.Behavioural
this deals between communication between classes and objects

21

There is no edmx support in Entity Framework Core.
 It only supports a code-first approach.
 The option to add a new Entity Data Model will be added,
 but it will produce entity class files instead of an edmx file.
 The tooling development is a little bit behind the framework development currently.


default return type of wbapi.---> By default Web API returns result in XML format

app.use vs app.run--->https://www.talkingdotnet.com/app-use-vs-app-run-asp-net-core-middleware/
app.Use may call next middleware component in the pipeline. On the other hand, middlware defined using app.Run will never call subsequent middleware. 

difference between private constructor and static constructor.
Private Constructor:- https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/private-constructor-c-sharp/
static constructor :-https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-the-use-of-static-constructors-in-chash
we can have only one static constructor

How to download any file

string DocIndex = model[0].DocIndex;

while uploading we upload files in omnidocs and we get an unique docindex for that file
while downloading we use that docindex and call the omnidocs service to get the response which indeed converted into
byte formate and below code is used to download file which returns file type as shown below

                    string FileName = model[0].DocName;
                    string docType = Path.GetExtension(FileName);

                    Byte[] buffer = CacheProvider.DownloadDocument(DocIndex, FileName, Constants.OmniDocsDocumentType.GHI);


                    if (buffer != null)
                    {
                        Response.ClearContent();
                        Response.ClearHeaders();
                        Response.AddHeader("Content-Disposition", "inline; filename=" + FileName);
                        Response.ContentType = "application/" + docType;
                        Response.OutputStream.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
                        Response.OutputStream.Flush();
                        Response.OutputStream.Close();
